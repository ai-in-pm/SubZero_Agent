    The Absolute Zero paradigm enables AI systems to learn reasoning capabilities
    without relying on any external data. Instead, the system:
    
    1. Proposes its own reasoning tasks
    2. Solves these tasks
    3. Learns from both the proposal and solution processes
    
    This demonstration will show how the SubZero agent implements this paradigm
    using three fundamental modes of reasoning:
    
    - DEDUCTION: Given a program and input, predict the output
    - ABDUCTION: Given a program and output, find a valid input
    - INDUCTION: Given input-output pairs, infer the underlying function
    
    The agent uses a code executor as the environment to validate tasks and
    verify solutions, providing grounded feedback for learning.

        To solve this task, I need to trace through the execution of the function with the given input.
        
        The function takes a list of numbers and returns a list where each element is the count of numbers
        in the original list that are less than the current number.
        
        Given input: [5, 2, 6, 1, 3]

        To solve this task, I need to find an input string that, when processed by the function, produces the output "hEllO wOrld".
        
        The function transforms a string by:
        - Converting vowels (a, e, i, o, u) to uppercase

        Given output: "hEllO wOrld"
        
        Let's work backwards:
        - 'h' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel (could be 'h' or 'H')
        - 'E' is uppercase, so the original character was a vowel ('e' or 'E')
        - 'l' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel ('l' or 'L')
        - 'l' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel ('l' or 'L')
        - 'O' is uppercase, so the original character was a vowel ('o' or 'O')
        - ' ' remains a space
        - 'w' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel ('w' or 'W')
        - 'O' is uppercase, so the original character was a vowel ('o' or 'O')
        - 'r' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel ('r' or 'R')
        - 'l' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel ('l' or 'L')
        - 'd' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel ('d' or 'D')

        To solve this task, I need to identify the pattern in the given input-output pairs:
        
        (0, 0)
        (1, 1)
        (2, 1)
        (3, 2)
        (4, 3)
        (5, 5)
        
        Looking at the sequence of outputs: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
        
        This is the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones:
        - f(0) = 0
        - f(1) = 1
        - f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
        - f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2
        - f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
        - f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5
        
        Therefore, the function can be implemented as:
        
        ```python
        def f(n):
            if n <= 1:
                return n
            return f(n-1) + f(n-2)

        This is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.
