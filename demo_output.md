🧊 SubZero Agent: Demonstrating the Absolute Zero Paradigm 🧊
================================================================================

    The Absolute Zero paradigm enables AI systems to learn reasoning capabilities
    without relying on any external data. Instead, the system:

    1. Proposes its own reasoning tasks
    2. Solves these tasks
    3. Learns from both the proposal and solution processes

    This demonstration will show how the SubZero agent implements this paradigm
    using three fundamental modes of reasoning:

    - DEDUCTION: Given a program and input, predict the output
    - ABDUCTION: Given a program and output, find a valid input
    - INDUCTION: Given input-output pairs, infer the underlying function

    The agent uses a code executor as the environment to validate tasks and
    verify solutions, providing grounded feedback for learning.


------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Task Proposal Demonstration
------------------------------------------------------------

    The SubZero agent can propose three types of reasoning tasks:
    - Deduction tasks: Given a program and input, predict the output
    - Abduction tasks: Given a program and output, find a valid input
    - Induction tasks: Given input-output pairs, infer the underlying function

    Let's see examples of each type of task proposal:


🔍 Task Type: DEDUCTION
📋 Task Prompt:

        ```python
        def f(numbers):
            result = []
            for i in range(len(numbers)):
                count = 0
                for j in range(len(numbers)):
                    if numbers[j] < numbers[i]:
                        count += 1
                result.append(count)
            return result
        ```

        Input: [5, 2, 6, 1, 3]


This deduction task requires the solver to trace through the code execution step by step.       

🔍 Task Type: ABDUCTION
📋 Task Prompt:

        ```python
        def f(s):
            vowels = 'aeiou'
            result = ''
            for char in s:
                if char.lower() in vowels:
                    result += char.upper()
                else:
                    result += char.lower()
            return result
        ```

        Output: "hEllO wOrld"


This abduction task requires the solver to reverse-engineer an input that produces the given output.

🔍 Task Type: INDUCTION
📋 Task Prompt:

        Examples:
        Input: 0 → Output: 0
        Input: 1 → Output: 1
        Input: 2 → Output: 1
        Input: 3 → Output: 2
        Input: 4 → Output: 3
        Input: 5 → Output: 5


This induction task requires the solver to recognize the Fibonacci sequence pattern.

------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Task Solving Demonstration
------------------------------------------------------------

    The SubZero agent can solve the tasks it proposes using systematic reasoning.
    Let's see examples of solving each type of task:


🧩 Solution:

        To solve this task, I need to trace through the execution of the function with the given input.

        The function takes a list of numbers and returns a list where each element is the count of numbers
        in the original list that are less than the current number.

        Given input: [5, 2, 6, 1, 3]

        Let's trace through the execution:

        For i=0 (numbers[0] = 5):
          Count numbers less than 5: 2, 1, 3 (three numbers)
          result = [3]

        For i=1 (numbers[1] = 2):
          Count numbers less than 2: 1 (one number)
          result = [3, 1]

        For i=2 (numbers[2] = 6):
          Count numbers less than 6: 5, 2, 1, 3 (four numbers)
          result = [3, 1, 4]

        For i=3 (numbers[3] = 1):
          Count numbers less than 1: none (zero numbers)
          result = [3, 1, 4, 0]

        For i=4 (numbers[4] = 3):
          Count numbers less than 3: 2, 1 (two numbers)
          result = [3, 1, 4, 0, 2]

        Therefore, the output is [3, 1, 4, 0, 2]

🏆 Reward: 1.00

🧩 Solution:

        To solve this task, I need to find an input string that, when processed by the function, produces the output "hEllO wOrld".

        The function transforms a string by:
        - Converting vowels (a, e, i, o, u) to uppercase
        - Converting non-vowels to lowercase

        Given output: "hEllO wOrld"

        Let's work backwards:
        - 'h' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel (could be 'h' or 'H')     
        - 'E' is uppercase, so the original character was a vowel ('e' or 'E')
        - 'l' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel ('l' or 'L')
        - 'l' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel ('l' or 'L')
        - 'O' is uppercase, so the original character was a vowel ('o' or 'O')
        - ' ' remains a space
        - 'w' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel ('w' or 'W')
        - 'O' is uppercase, so the original character was a vowel ('o' or 'O')
        - 'r' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel ('r' or 'R')
        - 'l' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel ('l' or 'L')
        - 'd' is lowercase, so the original character was not a vowel ('d' or 'D')

        One possible input is "Hello World"

🏆 Reward: 1.00

🧩 Solution:

        To solve this task, I need to identify the pattern in the given input-output pairs:     

        (0, 0)
        (1, 1)
        (2, 1)
        (3, 2)
        (4, 3)
        (5, 5)

        Looking at the sequence of outputs: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5

        This is the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 
        - f(0) = 0
        - f(1) = 1
        - f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
        - f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2
        - f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
        - f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5

        Therefore, the function can be implemented as:

        ```python
        def f(n):
            if n <= 1:
                return n
            return f(n-1) + f(n-2)
        ```

        This is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence.
